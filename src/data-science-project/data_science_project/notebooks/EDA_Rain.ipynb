        "\n",
        "Grupo Bimbo, a leading multinational bakery company, faces a unique challenge in managing the inventory of its products. With a typical shelf life of just one week, the accuracy of daily inventory calculations is paramount. Currently, these calculations are performed by direct delivery sales employees who rely on their personal experiences to predict the forces of supply, demand, and consumer behavior at each store. The margin for error in this process is minimal. Underestimating demand results in empty shelves and lost sales, while overestimating demand leads to excess product returns and increased expenses.\n",
        "\n",
        "Grupo Bimbo aims to create a predictive model that can accurately forecast inventory needs based on historical data, thereby optimizing the supply chain and improving efficiency.\n"
